# Rhythm Game (Working Title)

Built using [MonoGame](https://monogame.net). Currently using the font [Early GameBoy](https://www.dafont.com/early-gameboy.font) by [Jimmy Campbell](https://www.dafont.com/jimmy-campbell.d5241). All other assets (images, sounds, songs) are made by me.


## Requirements

- Only works on Windows right now
- .NET 9.0

## How To Install

1. Navigate to the [GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/inomjording/Rhythm-Game/actions/workflows/build.yaml).
2. Select the latest successful run from the workflow list.
3. Scroll down to the Artifacts and download the file "game".
4. Extract the files.
5. Open the "game"-folder and run the "RhythmGame"-application.
    1. The computer's security system will probably be upset. Run the application anyways.
    2. It might ask you to download net9.0. This is required to run the application.
